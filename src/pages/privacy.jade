        h3 Global Privacy Fundamentals
        p.
            Our privacy practices reflect current global principles and standards on handling personal information.

        h3 Personal Data Collected; Use and Purpose 
        p.
            The information SAP collects to understand your needs and interests helps SAP deliver a consistent and personalized experience. We will use such information only as described in this Privacy Statement and/or in the way we specify at the time of collection. We will not subsequently change the way your personal data is used without your consent, as required by applicable law. SAP requires your First and Last Name, Email Address and IP Address (“Personal Data”) to fulfill its obligation to deliver the Ruum by SAP service to you, to provide the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content and to provide customer feedback and support, including communication via email.
        p.

When you visit our site, we recognize only your domain name. SAP will only gather information related to your visit to this website or other SAP Group sites.

Any such use of information is based on the consent you grant hereunder.
        p.
